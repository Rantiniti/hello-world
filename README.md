# hello-world
greeting

Hi! The theme of my diploma was "Construction Planner". It was written on ASP.NET
But later I was interested in Java. I have warm feelings about coding in Java.
Unfortunatly, I've only met projects in C# at my work.
These days I study DS in SkillFactory
I use: Python, C#, SQL
